              So here's the short version to get some basic content on this
              page, full auto-biography coming soon(tm)
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Born in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, UK. Grew up with a passion for
              computers and technology. Played about with coding and
              ActionScript 2.0 in high school and a bit of PHP in college. Wanted
              to go to University to study computer science and get into
              programming, but it didn't work out.
            </p>
            <p>
              Worked in retail for about 10 and a half years, moved to
              Nottingham halfway through that to live with friends. In 2019, I
              eventually got my big break out of retail and into IT. It was
              basic first line tech support, but it was a start, it gave me the
              experience I needed on my CV in lack of a qualification. 2020 hits
              I break up with my partner who I was living with at the time. We
              decide it's best for working from home from my parents instead, so
              back to Great Yarmouth. I then pick up a new and better job here,
              it's a support job again, but it's their own software, so I get to
              work on a lot more and see/tweak the source code if needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nearly a year into the job, I've expressed an interest in moving
              from support over to development (as was my initial aspired job
              path which I'd dismissed as unobtainable). The plans are now in
              motion to move over from next year, but in the meantime I've been
              preparing myself by refreshing my already existing knowledge of
              HTML/CSS and learning JavaScript (Which to my benefit was a heavy
              source of inspiration for ActionScript which I had done in High
              School)

              My background on photography was covered pretty well on my first
              photography blog post which you can see here:
